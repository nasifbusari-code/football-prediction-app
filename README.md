A Flask-based web application for predicting football match outcomes (Over 1.5 and Under 3.5 goals) using machine learning models, real-time sports API data, and a custom rule-based confidence system. The system integrates user authentication, VIP subscriptions via Paystack, and automated daily predictions to deliver accurate football betting insights.

## Project Overview
Developed by Busari Nasif Stephen, this full-stack web application predicts football match outcomes using a hybrid machine learning approach. It fetches historical and upcoming match data from the AllSportsAPI, processes it through pre-trained machine learning models, and applies a custom `favour_v6_confidence` function to generate reliable predictions. The system features a Flask-based frontend, PostgreSQL for user management, and Paystack for VIP subscriptions. Predictions are generated daily and served to users based on access levels (free or VIP).

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Machine learning with ensemble models
- Real-time API integration
- Flask web development with secure authentication
- PostgreSQL database management
- Payment processing with Paystack
- Automated task scheduling with APScheduler
- Cloud deployment on Render

## Features
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Combines Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Naive Bayes, and Poisson distribution for Over 1.5 and Under 3.5 goals predictions.
- **Rule-Based Confidence**: Adjusts prediction confidence using `favour_v6_confidence` based on statistical rules (e.g., average goals, BTTS counts).
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches match data from AllSportsAPI, filtering out invalid matches (e.g., early red cards).
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and logout with bcrypt password hashing.
- **VIP Subscription**: Paystack integration for 7-day VIP access to detailed predictions.
- **Automated Predictions**: Daily predictions at 12:15 AM WAT via APScheduler, saved in JSON and text formats.
- **Responsive UI**: Bootstrap-styled templates for free and VIP users.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Uses `tenacity` for retrying API and database operations, with detailed logging.
- **Deployment-Ready**: Hosted on Render with secure environment variable management.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, scipy (Poisson), joblib
- **API**: AllSportsAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Payment**: Paystack API
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler
- **Other Libraries**: pandas, numpy, rapidfuzz, tenacity, python-dotenv, bcrypt, tqdm

UsageFree Users: View basic predictions (match and pick) at /.
VIP Users: Register at /register, log in at /login, purchase VIP access at /pay, and view detailed predictions at /vip or /predictions.
Admins: Log in with admin credentials for full access.
CLI Predictions: Run flask run-predictions for manual predictions.

Outputs are saved to predictions.json and predictions.txt. Logs are in prediction_log.txt.Detailed WorkflowThis workflow highlights the technical depth of the project for recruiters.1. Data AcquisitionAPI Integration: Queries AllSportsAPI for:League data (fetch_all_leagues): Cached in leagues_cache.json.
Upcoming matches (fetch_upcoming_matches): For targeted leagues (e.g., IDs 156, 302).
Historical data (fetch_match_data): Last 5 matches per team, excluding early red cards (<=70 minutes).

Error Handling: tenacity retries failed API calls (3 attempts, exponential backoff) with rate limit logging.
Validation: Fuzzy matching (rapidfuzz, 75% threshold) ensures team name accuracy.

2. Data PreprocessingFeature Engineering: Computes:Average goals scored/conceded.
BTTS counts, high-scoring matches (goals >= 2), low-conceded counts (<= 1).
Binary flags (e.g., heavy_conceding_boost).

Transformation: Scales features with favour_v6_base_scaler.pkl.
Poisson Modeling: Calculates expected goals and Over 1.5 probability.

3. Prediction PipelineBase Models: Five models predict Over 1.5 probabilities.
Rule-Based Confidence: favour_v6_confidence adjusts scores based on rules (e.g., high conceded goals, zero counts).
Meta-Model: Combines base model outputs, Poisson probabilities, and rule-based scores.
Recommendation: Suggests "Over 1.5" or "Under 3.5" if probabilities are 70–91% with a 15% confidence gap, else "NO BET".

4. Web ApplicationUser Management: PostgreSQL with bcrypt-secured passwords and connection pooling.
Routes:/: Free predictions.
/vip, /predictions: Detailed predictions for VIP/admins.
/pay, /paystack/callback: Paystack payment processing.

UI: Bootstrap templates for responsive design.

5. AutomationDaily Predictions: APScheduler runs at 12:15 AM WAT, saving results to predictions.json and predictions.txt.
Logging: Tracks API calls and errors in prediction_log.txt.

6. DeploymentEnvironment: Secured with python-dotenv.
Scalability: Deployed on Render with Gunicorn.
Monitoring: Database pings (/ping_db) and logs ensure reliability.

7. User ExperienceOutput: JSON and text files with confidence scores and reasoning.
Access: Free users see basic predictions; VIP users get detailed insights.
Feedback: Flash messages handle errors (e.g., expired VIP status).
